<h1 align="center">YAFF</h1>

YAFF is super simple framework for building CLI applications and microservices.
Has a DI system similar to Magento's (types, virtualTypes, preferences, etc.)
## Attention!
The framework was written exclusively for personal purposes in a few hours. <br><br><br>I understand that the quality of the kernel code is very bad. However, it serves all its purposes, so I will change as needed.
<br><br>I will also be happy to pull requests ;)
